    "The sales software used at your company is set to automatically back itself up, but no one knows exactly what time the back-ups happen. It is known, however, that back-ups happen exactly every 30 minutes. Amir comes back from sales meetings at random times to update the data on the client he just met with. He wants to know how long he'll have to wait for his newly-entered data to get backed up. Use your new knowledge of continuous uniform distributions to model this situation and answer Amir's questions.\n",
