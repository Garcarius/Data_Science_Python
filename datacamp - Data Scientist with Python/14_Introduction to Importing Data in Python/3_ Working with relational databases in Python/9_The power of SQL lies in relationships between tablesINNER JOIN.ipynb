    "Here, you'll perform your first `INNER JOIN`! You'll be working with your favourite SQLite database, `Chinook.sqlite`. For each record in the `Album` table, you'll extract the `Title` along with the `Name` of the `Artist`. The latter will come from the `Artist` table and so you will need to `INNER JOIN` these two tables on the `ArtistID` column of both.\n",
