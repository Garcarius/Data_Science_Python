    "The `pandas` package is also great at dealing with many of the issues you will encounter when importing data as a data scientist, such as comments occurring in flat files, empty lines and missing values. Note that missing values are also commonly referred to as `NA` or `NaN`. To wrap up this chapter, you're now going to import a slightly corrupted copy of the Titanic dataset `titanic_corrupt.txt`, which\n",
