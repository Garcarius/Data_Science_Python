    "While working on a data exploration project, you have been asked to visualize the number of reviews of hotels by `\"Period of stay\"` and by the day of the week, `\"Review weekday\"`. The goal of this visualization is to see what day of the week has the most reviews for each of the four periods of stay. The `reviews` dataset has been preloaded for you, as well as both `seaborn`, as `sns`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`."
