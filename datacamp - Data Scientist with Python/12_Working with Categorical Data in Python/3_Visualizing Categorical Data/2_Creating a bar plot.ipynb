    "# Creating a bar plot\n",
    "Las Vegas hotels are seeing large variations in how helpful reviews appear to other people. The owners of these hotels are curious if there are times of the year when reviews have been more helpful to their potential guests. Help the owners understand their reviews better by creating a bar plot of the average number of helpful votes per review across the categorical variable `\"Period of stay\"`. The dataset `reviews` has been preloaded for you."
