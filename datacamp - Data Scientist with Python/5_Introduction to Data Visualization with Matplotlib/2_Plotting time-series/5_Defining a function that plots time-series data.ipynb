    "# Defining a function that plots time-series data\n",
    "Once you realize that a particular section of code that you have written is useful, it is a good idea to define a function that saves that section of code for you, rather than copying it to other parts of your program where you would like to use this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will define a function that takes inputs such as a time variable and some other variable and plots them as x and y inputs. Then, it sets the labels on the x- and y-axis and sets the colors of the y-axis label, the y-axis ticks and the tick labels.\n",

    "* Define a function called `plot_timeseries` that takes as input an Axes object (`axes`), data `(x,y)`, a string with the name of a color and strings for x- and y-axis labels.\n",

    "Set the x- and y-axis labels using the provided input `xlabel` and `ylabel`, setting the y-axis label color using `color`.\n",
    "Set the y-axis tick parameters using the `tick_params` method of the Axes object, setting the colors key-word to color."
