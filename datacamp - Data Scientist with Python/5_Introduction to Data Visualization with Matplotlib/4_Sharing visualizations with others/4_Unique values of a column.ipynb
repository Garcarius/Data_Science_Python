    "In this exercise and the next, you will be visualizing the weight of athletes in the 2016 summer Olympic Games again, from a dataset that has some unknown number of branches of sports in it. This will be loaded into memory as a pandas `DataFrame` object called `summer_2016_medals`, which has a column called `\"Sport\"` that tells you to which branch of sport each row corresponds. There is also a \"Weight\" column that tells you the weight of each athlete.\n",
