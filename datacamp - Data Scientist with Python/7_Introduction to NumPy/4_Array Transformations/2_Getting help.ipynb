    "You'll need to use the `.astype()` array method we covered in the first chapter of this course for the next exercise. If you forget exactly how `.astype()` works, you could check out the course slides or NumPy's documentation on **[numpy.org](https://numpy.org/)**. There is, however, an even faster way to jog your memoryâ€¦\n",
