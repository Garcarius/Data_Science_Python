    "# Creating arrays from scratch\n",
    "It can be helpful to know how to create quick NumPy arrays from scratch in order to test your code. For example, when you are doing math with large multi-dimensional arrays, it's nice to check whether the math works as expected on small test arrays before applying your code to the larger arrays. NumPy has many options for creating smaller synthetic arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, it's time for you to create some arrays from scratch! `numpy` is imported for you as `np`."
