    "# Bringing it all together: testing your error handling skills\n",
    "You have just written error handling into your `count_entries()` function so that, when the user passes the function a column (as 2nd argument) NOT contained in the DataFrame (1st argument), a `ValueError` is thrown. You're now going to play with this function: it is loaded into pre-exercise code, as is the DataFrame `tweets_df`. Try calling `count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')` to confirm that the function behaves as it should. Then call `count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang1')`: what is the last line of the output?"
