    "Sometimes, data sources can be so large in size that storing the entire dataset in memory becomes too resource-intensive. In this exercise, you will process the first 1000 rows of a file line by line, to create a dictionary of the counts of how many times each country appears in a column in the dataset.\n",

    "The csv file `'world_dev_ind.csv'` is in your current directory for your use. To begin, you need to open a connection to this file using what is known as a context manager. For example, the command `with open('datacamp.csv') as datacamp` binds the csv file `'datacamp.csv'` as `datacamp` in the context manager. Here, the `with` statement is the context manager, and its purpose is to ensure that resources are efficiently allocated when opening a connection to a file.\n",
